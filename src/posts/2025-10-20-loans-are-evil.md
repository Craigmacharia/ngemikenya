Mobile loan apps in Kenya, while offering quick cash, have ensnared many in a cycle of abuse. High interest rates, often exceeding 30%, trap borrowers in debt. Aggressive debt collection tactics, including harassment via calls and texts, shame defaulters publicly. Some apps access personal data, violating privacy. Kenyans, desperate for funds, face mental distress and financial ruin. The Central Bank has flagged unregulated apps, but enforcement lags. Calls for stricter oversight grow as citizens seek protection from predatory lending practices.
