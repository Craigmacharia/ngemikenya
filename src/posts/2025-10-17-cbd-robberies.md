In Nairobi, a surge in robberies by organized goons has left residents on edge. Operating in small, armed gangs, these criminals target pedestrians, motorists, and businesses, particularly in areas like Eastleigh and the CBD. Using knives and guns, they steal cash, phones, and valuables, often striking at night. Police patrols have intensified, but the goons exploit poorly lit streets and lax security. Community watch groups are forming, and the DCI is investigating, yet fear persists as Nairobians demand stronger measures to curb the rising menace.
